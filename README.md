# dpgui-maker
GUI app using DearPyGui to make GUI apps in DearPyGui

## Features
1) A Live window of what's being added is shown.
2) A summary in the form of tree widget is also shown.
3) Saving saves to your_project.py in your cwd.
4) Modify any parameter except tag. If tag needs to be modified, just remove and re-create the item with new tag.

## Note
Some widgets need extra necessary parameters (example- add_line_series). Program will crash if they are not supplied with.
This is intended for live visualisation and faster generation of code.
This is not a fullfledged app.


## Development
I'm doing this as a hobby. I'm not part of DPG team.
